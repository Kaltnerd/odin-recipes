    <ol class="prep">
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roast for 40 mins, stirring
          everything halfway through.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Toss the sweet potatoes with a generous drizzle of oil and some
          seasoning, and tip into a very large roasting tin.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Push the potatoes to one end of the tin, then, in the other end, toss
          the chicken with the onions, spice mix, a drizzle of oil and some
          seasoning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the broccoli to the tin, drizzle with a little oil and season,

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove the chicken, onions and broccoli from the tin. Roughly mash the
          potatoes using a fork, making sure you incorporate all the chicken

      </li>
