      </li>
      <li>oil, for drizzling</li>
      <li>
        6-8 chicken thighs, skin left on 2 red onions, cut into wedges 25g
        sachet
      </li>
      <li>
        piri-piri spice mix (or a mild version, if you like) 300g long-stem
        broccoli
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roast for 40 mins, stirring
        everything halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the sweet potatoes with a generous drizzle of oil and some
        seasoning, and tip into a very large roasting tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push the potatoes to one end of the tin, then, in the other end, toss
        the chicken with the onions, spice mix, a drizzle of oil and some
        seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the broccoli to the tin, drizzle with a little oil and season, then
        roast for 10-15 mins more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken, onions and broccoli from the tin. Roughly mash the
        potatoes using a fork, making sure you incorporate all the chicken
        juices and spices from the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the mash over the base of the tin, then top with the broccoli,
        chicken and onions and serve from the tin in the middle of the table.
      </li>
